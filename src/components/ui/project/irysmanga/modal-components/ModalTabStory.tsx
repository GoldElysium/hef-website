				The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a
				disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the
				life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries,
				but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling,
				have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to
				widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to
				physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on
				the natural world. The continued development of technology will
				worsen the situation.

				It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and
				inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably
				lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering,
				and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in
				“advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may
				survive or it may break down.
