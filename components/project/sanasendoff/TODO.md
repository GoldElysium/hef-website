# TODO

I'm really behind on where I'd like to be with this project, but I also have a
job that I need to get things done for, and that saps all my energy...

On top of that, I intitially went way too ambitious, and was gonna do all this
webGL shit with canvas fallback and there just isn't the time for that.

So, whats here is the bare bones stuff that I have, its not a lot, but I plan
to get most of it done in the next two days, since I'm off of work then.
